      I have been writing and playing music circa 2012 when I first picked up a
      guitar. Come 2015 marked the beginning of recording and producing music on
      my own, experimenting with the limited gear I had and indulging the
      passion to learn. I managed to pick up the necessary basics from
      microphones to cables to interfaces and software. This evolved into my
      full-circle approach, tackling all musical steps from conception to
      master. I was able to form a band (including my brother on drums) for a
      few years just to experiment with songwriting and performance. For a short
      amount of time, I was an intern at Comma Music in 2017, and was highly
      exposed to the more corporate world of audio. Being a commercial audio
      studio, I soon realized marketing didn’t fulfill my calling. In 2018, I
      began working with Studio Kai in a casual manner. Kai specialized in rap,
      hip hop, and pop, yet sometimes dabbled in bands. Purely as a friendly,
      helpful presence, I absorbed many lessons in professional recording and
      industry moves. Also in 2018, I formed Totem Frogs, my main band and
      musical project to this day! Establishing a solo project and joining
      another band (Joey Acopiado Band) happened in 2020. I used my pandemic
      time that year to study the depth of my musical endeavors and began
      building up my own studio. In 2021, I established myself as an intern at
      Kai in order to get hands-on higher training in audio recording, mixing,
      and mastering. Later that year, I was given a test and earned the title of
      engineer. Having a personal education coupled with hands-on experience and
      pure passion left me ready to control a production company of my own.
      Focussing on the artistic process and a “living” recording, I attempt to
      lead a path through the audio jungle towards a new musical oasis. I’ve
      worked with many genres and artists from : Vernon Hill, Totem Frogs, Joey
      Acopiado, Sean Mckee Band, eZquire, Lazy E, Maskboy, and more.

      Hey, I'm Josh. I've been on a musically random quest to hear interesting, chilling new sounds. In my early youth, I was certain my future rested in film scoring. My friend Emily had a huge passion for cinema and being her nextdoor neighbor we would jollyly put together amateur short films. As great as Jeremy Zuckerman's scoring of Avatar the Last Airbender struck me like nothing else, I knew there was a volume I was missing. It wasn't until I played my first live show with the School of Rock in 2010 that I discovered a brand new aspiration.. live music. My heart lives with the keys, mainly growing up enjoying a whimsical yet psychedelic style of performance. Having a third generation Baldwin piano in the house, low times never really hit too hard being blessed with the opportunity to tickle the ivories whenever stress built up. Not having any solid direction, my spontaneity led me to Tucson, Arizona in 2019. There I formed an everlasting friendship with the drummer Alejandro, and together we formed the band eZquire. Trying to balance a life of avid exploration and playing music, my day-to-day took a beautiful and dramatic turn when in the summer of 2022 I joined the Joey Acopiado Band at The Irish Mill back home in the northern suburbs of Chicago. Through that experience I met Alex Garrin, and eventually joined Totem Frogs as the keys guy. Other than any genre that blows my mind, I also have a zealous respect for Syd Barret and am thoroughly entertained by the production of his solo endeavors. Furthermore, I am enthralled to work with these up and coming artists and inspired by the musicians I have already had the honor of connecting with.

      Max's Bio that he will write or already has written. I am unsure of what
      he will write or how much he will write. Either way, he'll have to write
      something, and when he does I will replace this text with what he writes.
